* Builder pattern builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach.
* Builder pattern aims to “Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.”
* Builder pattern solves the issue with large number of optional parameters and inconsistent state by providing a way to build the object step-by-step and provide a method that will actually return the final Object.
