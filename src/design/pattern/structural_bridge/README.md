#### Bridge Pattern
Bridge design pattern is used to decouple a class into two parts – abstraction and it’s implementation – so that both can evolve in future without affecting each other. It increases the loose coupling between class abstraction and it’s implementation.

You get this decoupling by adding one more redirection between methods calls from abstraction to implementation.
